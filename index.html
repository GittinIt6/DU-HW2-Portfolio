        <article id="AboutMeText">
            <p>I have over 22 years of diverse experience within the Information Technology field. I have worked hands on performing desktop and service desk support, server support, data center management, IT architecture design, and managed teams which perform those duties, while building my knowledge through highly specific technical training and experience in the field. I've also gained valuable experience in the past few years implementing public cloud technologies.
            </p>
            <p>I have experience supporting small business technology when time permits for companies such as the Daisy Mountain Fire Department in Anthem, AZ and First United Door Technologies based out of Tempe, AZ.
            </p>
            Since joining the Denver International Airport, I have been a member of the Auxiliary Snow Removal team driving heavy equipment and plow vehicles when snow levels warrant additional assistance. I am also a member of the Great Hall Passenger Assistance Program.
            </p>
            <p>I have a passion for the outdoors (hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, paddle boarding, wake boarding, road biking). I have participated in the MS Ride five consecutive years.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally as time permits, I am an active member of a professional UTV off-road race team. I hold many roles in planning, technology, crew management, and have been the co-pilot for several races. Of the races where I was a co-pilot, the most prestigious was the 2021 Baja 1000, where our team placed 1st in the UTV Pro Open class in a brutal 1200 mile non-stop race down the Baja Peninsula.
